# How to add a new receipt for Receipt Scanner 
## Note: Receipt Images with only .jpg format will work
## Our Receipt Scanner works best with 'Giant Eagle' receipts. Its best to use a Giant Eagle receipt when testing, though other receipts will give a fairly accurate output too

1. Take a picture of your receipt or download from the Internet (.jpg format) 
2. Drag the Image in the gallery of the app simmulator 
3. If you are testing on your device, the app will open the phone gallery and you can select the image of the receipt for scan.
