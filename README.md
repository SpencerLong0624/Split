6. Scanning a receipt <br/>
<b> Note: Receipt Images with only .jpg format will work </b> <br/>
<b> Our Receipt Scanner works best with 'Giant Eagle' receipts. Its best to use a Giant Eagle receipt when testing, though other receipts will give a fairly accurate output too </b> <br/>
  * Take a picture of your receipt or download from the Internet (.jpg format) 
* Drag the Image in the gallery of the app simmulator 
* If you are testing on your device, the app will open the phone gallery and you can select the image of the receipt for scan.
